A very simple bash script which uses wpctl to toggle microphone mute on linux.

### Features:
Uses PipeWire to mute/unmute
Plays a toggle on/off sound using aplay command

### Dependencies:
aplay,
pipewire,
wpctl

### Installation:
Simply download these files and put them in a folder anywhere. Make sure the bash script has execute permission.

Make sure you have the dependencies installed. On most linux distros they should be preinstalled. (Tested on Fedora 40)

### Usage:
Create a global shortcut in your preffered desktop environment and tell it to execute this script
